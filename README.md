## What?

A webpage to see your spotify history data

## How?

React, Next.js and TailwindCSS (making use of the API feature instead of express server.js)

## Why?

Everyone loves data, especially when it's about themselves. And all those Spotify nerds out there (myself included) have to wait until the end of the year for spotify to release that information in a colourful format with an option to share. This allows you to access that data at any time.
